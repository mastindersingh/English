Pytest and Code Coverage Configuration Guide
This document describes how to configure pytest and coverage.py to measure code coverage in a Python project where:

Source code is in the maturity_assessments_ms/ folder

Test files are in the tests/ folder

📁 Project Directory Structure
bash
Copy
Edit
project-root/
├── assessment/      # Your source code
├── tests/                        # All test files
├── pytest.ini                    # Pytest configuration
├── .coveragerc                   # Coverage configuration
├── requirements.txt              # Project dependencies
└── .github/workflows/ci.yml      # GitHub Actions workflow
⚙️ pytest.ini Configuration
Create this file in the root of your project:


[pytest]
addopts = --cov=assessment --cov-config=.coveragerc --cov-report term-missing --junitxml=pytest_report.xml
testpaths = tests
Explanation:

--cov: Collects coverage only for your code folder

--cov-report term-missing: Shows uncovered lines in terminal

--junitxml: Generates XML for test reporting

testpaths: Specifies where the tests are located

📘 .coveragerc Configuration
Create this file in the project root to exclude unwanted files:


[report]
omit =
    */tests/*
    */site-packages/*
    */python3.11/*
    */__init__.py
