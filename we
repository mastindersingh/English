* Task 1 - Workspace Enhancement:
    * We currently lack the necessary binaries and access to download packages for this task.
    * Collaboration with multiple teams is essential for this task, but there might be constraints due to role restrictions and potential reluctance to share resources and information.
* 		Task 2 - Static Monitoring Enhancement:
    * There are restrictions on downloading software from open-source GitHub for use within office, and alternative methods have not been successful.
    * Kubernetes is already installed, and I can revisit and possibly modify the JavaScript once the necessary access and information are granted.
* 		Task 3 - Email Enhancement (Including Kibana and APM Status):
    * mr is already working on enhancing the email system to include Kibana and APM status, making it redundant for me to create a new solution parallelly.
