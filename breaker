Hi Peter,

I hope you’re doing well. I wanted to follow up on the referral made by Deepali Choudhary for the Lead Systems Operations Engineer position in your team.

I’ve applied for the role and am genuinely excited about the opportunity to contribute. With my background in EFT systems, Python, AWS, CI/CD, and automation, along with my recent experience at Wells Fargo as an Integration Engineer, I believe I can add value to your team.

If you’re available, I’d love the chance to connect and discuss the position further.

Looking forward to hearing from you.
