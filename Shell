The provided script is a Bash script that performs a series of tasks related to running Ansible playbooks in different environments ("prod" and "BCP") and saving the output to CSV files. Let's break down each part of the script:

bash
Copy code
#!/bin/bash
This line is called a "shebang," and it indicates that the script should be executed using the Bash shell.

bash
Copy code
# Set the output directory for the second script
output_dir="/tmp/crontab_output/prod_and_bcp"
Here, a variable named output_dir is defined, which specifies the path to the output directory where the script will store its results. It's set to "/tmp/crontab_output/prod_and_bcp."

bash
Copy code
# Create the output directory if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p "$output_dir"
This command uses mkdir to create the output directory specified in the output_dir variable. The -p option ensures that the directory is created along with any necessary parent directories, and it won't produce an error if the directory already exists.

bash
Copy code
# Define a list of Ansible playbooks
playbooks=("crontabelastic.yml" "crontabkibana.yml")
Here, an array named playbooks is defined, containing the names of two Ansible playbook files: "crontabelastic.yml" and "crontabkibana.yml."

bash
Copy code
# Iterate over playbooks
for playbook in "${playbooks[@]}"; do
This for loop iterates over each playbook defined in the playbooks array.

bash
Copy code
    # Iterate over directories starting with "clusters/PROD" and "clusters/BCP"
    for dir in clusters/PROD* clusters/BCP*; do
Nested within the playbook loop is another for loop that iterates over directories that match the patterns "clusters/PROD*" and "clusters/BCP*." This means it will go through directories with names starting with "PROD" or "BCP" within the "clusters" directory.

bash
Copy code
        if [[ -d "$dir" && "$(basename "$dir")" != "prdomon" ]]; then
This line checks if the current item being iterated ($dir) is a directory (-d check) and if the base name of the directory (extracted using basename) is not equal to "prdomon." This is used to filter out directories that are not needed for processing.

bash
Copy code
            # Determine whether the directory is for "prod" or "BCP"
            if [[ "$dir" == *"prod"* ]]; then
                env="prod"
            elif [[ "$dir" == *"BCP"* ]]; then
                env="BCP"
            else
                env="unknown"
            fi
This section of the script determines whether the directory being processed represents the "prod" or "BCP" environment and assigns the result to the env variable. If the directory name contains "prod," it sets env to "prod"; if it contains "BCP," it sets env to "BCP"; otherwise, it sets env to "unknown."

bash
Copy code
            # Create a directory for the environment if it doesn't exist
            env_output_dir="$output_dir/$env"
            mkdir -p "$env_output_dir"
Here, the script constructs the path to the output directory for the specific environment ($env_output_dir) and uses mkdir -p to create it if it doesn't already exist.

bash
Copy code
            # Create a CSV file name based on the playbook and directory
            csv_filename="$env_output_dir/$(basename "$dir")_$playbook.csv"
This line constructs a CSV file name based on the environment ($env), the base name of the directory, and the current playbook being processed.

bash
Copy code
            echo "Running ansible-playbook $playbook -i $dir/hosts >> $csv_filename"
This line prints a message indicating the Ansible playbook that is being executed, the inventory file being used ($dir/hosts), and the output redirection to the CSV file ($csv_filename).

bash
Copy code
            # Run the Ansible playbook and save the output to the CSV file
            ansible-playbook "$playbook" -i "$dir/hosts" >> "$csv_filename"
Finally, this command runs the specified Ansible playbook using the inventory file from the current directory and appends the output to the CSV file. The >> operator is used for output redirection to append the output to the file.

The script essentially automates the execution of Ansible playbooks for different environments, saving the playbook results in separate CSV files based on the environment and playbook names.

Please note that this script assumes a specific directory structure and naming conventions for your Ansible playbook and inventory files. Adjustments may be needed if your directory structure differs.
