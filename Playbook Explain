This line specifies the hosts or target machines on which the tasks in this playbook will be executed. It seems to target hosts named "Kibana" and "Elastic."

yaml

  tasks:
Here begins the list of tasks that Ansible will execute on the specified hosts.

yaml
Copy code
    - =
This task creates an empty file named "output.csv" on the local machine (localhost).

yaml
Copy code
    
This task uses the shell command to retrieve the hostname of the local machine and stores it in a variable named "hostname."

yaml
This task uses the shell command to get the current date and time and stores it in a variable named "date."

yaml
C
This task combines the host groups "Kibana" and "Elastic" and stores the result in a variable named "hosts."

yaml

This task checks if a systemd service file named "Kibana.boot.service" exists on the local machine and records the result in the variable "kibana_boot_service."

yaml
C
Similar to the previous task, this one checks if a systemd service file named "Elastic-9200-boot.service" exists and records the result in the variable "elastic_9200_boot_service."

yaml
C
This final task appends lines to the "output.csv" file. It writes the hostname of a target host, the local machine's hostname, the current date and time, the status of the Kibana boot service, and the status of the Elastic boot service for each host specified in the "hosts" variable.
