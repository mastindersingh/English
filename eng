I am writing to bring to your attention the significant challenges I am currently facing both personally and professionally. As many of you may know, my family resides in the United States, and I am in the process of planning to join them. This period is proving to be a particularly difficult time for me, and I am in need of understanding and support from my colleagues and superiors.

Despite these personal challenges, I remain committed to my work and responsibilities. I have been diligently working on a PIP and have been striving to maintain a mistake-free and efficient work environment. I believe in my technical capabilities and am confident in my ability to contribute positively to our team's goals.

However, I have encountered difficulties in collaborating with some team members, which has added to my stress. I understand that everyone, including Manjeet, has their workload and responsibilities. However, I am surprised and disheartened by the lack of support and collaboration in our team. I have noticed that there is a reluctance to share knowledge and work together, which is crucial in Agile environments.

I would like to request [Rajanâ€™s Last Name] to kindly speak with Manjeet to foster better understanding and collaboration within our team. It is essential for our team to communicate effectively and support each other during challenging times. I believe that with open communication and collaboration, we can efficiently complete our tasks and projects, including the POC upgrade and Elastic certification preparation that I am currently working on.

I am open to having a call with all concerned parties to discuss and resolve these issues. I believe that through mutual understanding and support, we can create a positive and productive work environment for everyone.
