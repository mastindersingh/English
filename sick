First and foremost, thank you for the valuable discussion we had yesterday. Your guidance is always greatly appreciated.



I am writing to inform you of my current health situation and to provide an update on the PIP tasks. I have been experiencing severe chest pain and shortness of breath since last night, and am seeking immediate medical attention. Due to this, I will be on sick leave .



Regarding the PIP tasks, I have meticulously followed the Agile process and have ensured that all tasks are up to date. Every action and decision has been documented in emails and JIRA, with the full consent of our global team. I have also forwarded all relevant details, including email conversations and screenshots, to HR for their records and your reference.



In my absence, if there are any specific tasks or concerns, I am confident they can be addressed upon my return. I have taken all necessary steps to inform secondary person  both on call and email along with dropping him  message to inform my absence and will  login if he is not available as there is important task of verification pending for Cr which will happen early morning 



Thank you for your understanding and support during this time. I will keep both you and HR updated on my health status and anticipated date of return.
